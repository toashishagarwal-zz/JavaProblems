The railroad was not the first institution to impose regularity on
society, or to draw attention to the importance of precise
timekeeping. For as long as merchants have set out their wares at
Line daybreak and communal festivities have been celebrated, people
have been in rough agreement with their neighbors as to the time of
 day. The value of this tradition is today more apparent than ever.
 Were it not for public acceptance of a single yardstick of time,
 social life would be unbearably chaotic: the massive daily transfers
 of goods, services, and information would proceed in fits and
starts; the very fabric of modern society would begin to unravel.
